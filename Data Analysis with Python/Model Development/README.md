## In this model development, we will calculate R^2 and MSE in different models like linear regression, multi linear regression and polynomial regression. The result images are as follows:

#### 1. Multiple Linear Regression:

#### 2. Model Evaluation Using Visualization:
####  We can see from this plot that price is negatively correlated to highway-mpg since the regression slope is negative

#### 3. Creaye Residual Plot:

#### 4. Polynomial Regression and Pipelines 
#### a. Three order polynomial model:
