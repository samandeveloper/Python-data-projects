## In this model development, we will calculate R^2 and MSE in different models like linear regression, multi linear regression and polynomial regression. The result images are as follows:

#### 1. Multiple Linear Regression:

#### 2. Polynomial Regression and Pipelines:
#### Polynomial regression is a particular case of the general linear regression model or multiple linear regression models (Polynomial Fit with Matplotlib for Price ~ Length)

##### 3. Model Evaluation Using Visualization:
####  #We can see from this plot that price is negatively correlated to highway-mpg since the regression slope is negative

#### 4. Creaye Residual Plot:
